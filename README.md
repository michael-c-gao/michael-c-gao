### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub! I am currently a 4th year Computer Science student at the University of Oregon with an expected graduation date of 06/2022. I have experience in front-end (HTML, CSS, PHP), back-end (Python, C, C#, C++), and databases (MySQL). I am currently looking for entry-level SWE positions upon graduation.
